    <h1>Welcome to the Switzerland Site</h1>
    <p>This is a demo of a country switcher that redirects you to the appropriate site based on your geographical
        location. For your project, I will use a geolocation API to determine the user's location and update the link
        accordingly.</p>
    <p>For this demo, I have used Javascript to return a random choice between Germany and Switzerland. To see how it
        works, refresh the site several times and incase the computer has randomly chosen Germany, the pop up will
        appear. If not, you will stay on this sample Switzerland website </p>

    <div class="country-switcher">
        <a href="germany.html">Germany</a> |
        <a href="index.html">Switzerland</a>
    </div>

    <script>
        // Simulate the geolocation detection
        function getCountryCode() {
            // In a real implementation, you would use a geolocation API to get the country code.
            // For this example, we'll just return 'DE' (Germany) or 'CH' (Switzerland) based on a random choice.
            return Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'DE' : 'CH';
        }

        document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
            var countryCode = getCountryCode();
            var currentPage = 'switzerland'; // Simulate the current page (either 'germany' or 'switzerland')

            if (countryCode === 'DE' && currentPage === 'switzerland') {
                if (confirm("Looks like you are from Germany, do you want to visit the site for Germany?")) {
                    window.location.href = "germany.html";
                }
            } else if (countryCode === 'CH' && currentPage === 'germany') {
                if (confirm("Looks like you are from Switzerland, do you want to visit the site for Switzerland?")) {
                    window.location.href = "index.html";
                }
